This repository hosts a set of design documents for the TR-108 Picorder. A Picorder is a Raspberry Pi based handheld device that records and displays sensor data for immediate analysis. The TR-109 is designed to use a Raspberry Pi Zero W, a set of custom designed PCBs, and a 3D printed enclosure to achieve this goal. This project, along with [PicorderOS](https://squaredwave.com/wiki/index.php?title=PicorderOS) attempts to be a single self contained solution for anyone wishing to produce their own Picorder.

## What is included:

- The design_docs folder contains a crude SVG file that shows the 2D layout of the original design, mostly to scale. The SVG includes a crude wiring diagram.

- The pcb_design folder contains KiCad files of the proposed printed circuit board to replace the original perfboard prototype. These files can be used to produce and test PCBs.


## What is not yet included:

- There are no assembly instructions. I hope to produce some in the future.



While it is not required, if you make a picorder using this repository I would appreciate you sharing photos or videos your build with me at chris@squaredwave.com.
